                    <h3>Project context</h3>
                    <p>With an unprecedented increase in illegally hunting and trading of animals, organized criminals
                        networks across the globe continue to threaten species with extinction. United for Wildlife is an
                        initiative led by the Duke of Cambridge to stop wildlife crime.</p>
                    <p>Edenspiekermann worked with United for Wildlife to create a solution that prevents traffickers from
                        exploiting unsuspecting transport businesses to move their contraband. Taskforce Wildlife provides a
                        space where transport representatives and wildlife rangers can share intel about risks and routes so
                        that decisions are made from the most informed and global standpoint. During my internship at
                        Edenspiekermann, I worked with a visual designer and technical director to see this project through
                        its iterations to the MVP release in summer 2018.</p>
                    <h3>Establishing trust and awareness</h3>
                    <p><b>Problem:</b> Traffickers heavily rely on transport businesses to move their cargo and go to
                        elaborate lengths to ensure their operations go unnoticed and unreported. Without live reports from
                        the frontline, businesses resort to dated news reports from scattered sources to make logistical
                        decisions. As a result, businesses often unwittingly enter trafficking situations.</p>
                    <p>With the problem identified, we defined the following prompts for the solution:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How might we create and maintain a platform that businesses can
                            bank on during times of uncertainty and urgency?
                        </li>
                        <li>How might we help businesses ship their cargo from the most
                            informed and global standpoint?
                        </li>
                        <li>How might we introduce updated and alerts without overwhelming
                            businesses?
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Product goal</h3>
                    <p>Taskforce Wildlife aims to collect real-time reports from onsite rangers to inform transport
                        businesses on which routes traffickers have comprised and how they can make their cargo more
                        resilient.</p>

                    <h3>The design</h3>

                    <h4>Starting with clarity</h4>
                    <p>After asking users to enter information about their cargo, the Risk Calculator creates a tailored
                        risk report for that route and shipment. The page needed prompt action from the businesses without
                        alarming them with an overload of warnings but also without downplaying the severity or urgency of
                        the issue. To achieve this, we made sure the platform was focused on clarity and brevity. This was
                        imperative for Taskforce Wildlife to curb trafficking at a global scale.
                    </p>

                            <p>As a decision support tool, Taskforce Wildlife needed to keep the user's flow of thought and
                                attention until they find the information they need. Understanding a bit of the magic behind
                                calculating trafficking risk allowed the design to better follow the inner workings of a logistician
                                or wildlife ranger’s workflow. By focusing on streamlining each task, users can procure the
                                information they need and return to their real life situations quickly.</p>

                            <p>Rangers needed to be able to access Taskforce Wildlife in rural locations and precarious conditions
                                to send reports in real time. It needed to be lightweight, yet reliable. This meant working closely
                                with developers to create a design consisting of a component set that was fluid across all screen
                                sizes and browser versions.</p>

                    <h3>The retrospective</h3>
                    <p>The most valuable takeaway from being a part of this project was learning how designers, developers,
                        engineers could work in close proximity to make projects more future proof. For instance, Taskforce
                        Wildlife was implemented as a series of micro-services that allowed huge amounts of data can be
                        shared in a scalable manner. This meant that each of the tools within the platform is autonomous and
                        modular. This allowed our team to implement different parts of the design simultaneously while
                        understanding decisions behind the decision from multiple perspectives.</p>
