<ProjectHeading title='Product designer with a passion for building equitable and purposeful systems' abstract='Currently a product designer at Microsoft' borderBottom />

I've worked with organizations both large and small on identifying user needs throughout all phases of product development while practicing iterative design, testing, and delivery. I am happiest when Iâ€™m collaborating with diverse, cross functional teammates. I believe in using design to grapple with human complexities instead of paring them away.
