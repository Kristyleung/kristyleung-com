## Context

There‚Äôs always been a looming problem in gaming - players on one console can‚Äôt play with those on another.

Although players have accepted this reality to be the norm, my team and I have worked to break down these silos and bring players together in a way not previously possible enabling a new technology called cross-play.

![With the cross-play services I co-designed, our players are able to play with any other player in the EA network.](./ea-players-with-crossplay.png)

To create these cross-play services, I co-designed and continue to own all social coordination features required for players to play safely and fairly across platforms.

## Impact

Currently, blockbuster games like [Apex Legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/ea-play-announcements) and [Star Wars: Squadrons](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/squadrons/tips-and-tricks/how-to-play-with-friends-in-star-wars-squadrons) have already adopted crossplay functionality, which is defined by the design system I helped create. As a result, players of both franchises can now play with any other player across consoles and devices.

This current project is under an NDA. However, I would be glad to discuss my experience and learnings at Electronic Arts over a Zoom call.
